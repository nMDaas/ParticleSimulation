# Fluid Particle Simulation

## Introduction

I started this project because I was curious about how fluid particle simulations work in software like Houdini. While working on it, I learned about the physics behind how particles move to mimic different types of fluids. This included exploring Verlet integration, the Beerâ€“Lambert law, the Weber number, and aspects of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).

Using my experience with OpenGL, Phong shading in GLSL, and point lighting, I built a simulation preview that visualizes only the raw particles. This project also provided a great opportunity to explore techniques including ray marching, volumetric lighting, and performance optimizations such as spatial hashing and multithreading. 

Here are some things that were done here:
