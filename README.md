# Fluid Particle Simulation

## Introduction

I started this project because I was curious about how fluid particle simulations work in software like Houdini. Like any DCC application, this program supports both a simulation preview (visualizing raw particles) and a renderer (using ray marching with volumetric lighting).

Here are some things that were done here: 
- This included exploring Verlet integration, the Beerâ€“Lambert law, the Weber number, and aspects of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).
- Using my experience with OpenGL, Phong shading in GLSL, and point lighting
- techniques including ray marching, volumetric lighting
- performance optimizations such as spatial hashing and multithreading.

## 2D Fluid Simulation With PyGame
- Implemented basic fluid dynamics in 2D first to work out simulation physics and math correctly
- Implemented Verlet integration and the Weber number
